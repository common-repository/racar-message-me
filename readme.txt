RaCar Message Me allows you to add a customizable button with the social networks you set up.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a customizable button with your social networks inboxes (direct message). The button appears on the left bottom corner of your website by default, but you can change it to the right. When clicked, it'll take the user to your social network private message inbox. Currently supports WhatsApp, Instagram DM, Facebook Messenger, Microsoft Skype and Telegram.

= AFTER INSTALL =

After installation and activation, on the plugins page, find RaCar Message Me on the list and click 'settings' right under the title. It'll take you to the plugin's settings page. Another way of getting there is through the left admin menu. Find the RaCar Plugins handle and click it.

= HOW TO USE IT =

On settings page, choose the desired options and what social networks you want to use, then add the required information. It will automatically appear in your site's front end. If anything looks weird, hit Ctrl + F5 (or Command + F5). 


= RESET SETTINGS =
So far, the only way to reset your settings is unistalling the plugin and installing it back on. Just deactivating and activating will NOT reset settings, only the unistalling will. 

= Languages =
